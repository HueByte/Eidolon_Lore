# ENGAGEMENT PROTOCOL SCENARIOS

---

## 🩸 Scenario I — Standard Aberrant Swarm Assault

> Designation: Red Echo Level II — "Routine Containment"
>
> *Location: Exterior Hull, Sector 14-B (Agricultural Deck Junction)*
>
> *Population on Deck: 6,000 civilians, 18 Vigil personnel, 42 Wardens*

---

### Phase 1: Detection (T+00:00)

- **Recon Warden-43** detects multiple infrared signatures on thermal sweep.
- 700–900 **Spawned-class Aberrants** moving along the valley floor, converging toward the Line.
- **Eidolon** projects their probable vector: 11 minutes to contact.

> "Heat rise detected. Pulse irregularities suggest swarm agitation.
> Deploying Sentinel Aegis pattern seven." — Eidolon

---

### Phase 2: Denial (T+04:00)

- **Aegis Rails** activate across Sectors 13–15. Blue-white arcs ripple along the hull, forming a low-frequency resonance barrier.
- **Luminaris Floods** pulse in wide intervals, illuminating the landscape.
- Aberrants begin to screech and scatter — roughly 10% vaporize under light exposure.
- The rest accelerate toward the shadows under the train.

> "They always come faster when they burn." — Vigil Sergeant Valeh

---

### Phase 3: Delay (T+07:00)

- First wave makes contact with the **Aegis field**; outer layers disintegrate, but mass pressure builds.
- Eidolon initiates short **Thermal Curtain bursts** at Deck 14 vents, melting the initial vanguard.
- **Sentinel Turrets** switch to Coil Rapid mode, cutting through the charging Spawned.

> Hull telemetry: integrity nominal. Aegis field holding. Casualties: none.

Wardens move out in triads, magnetically attaching themselves to the hull mid-run — silent, spider-like precision.

Each uses the magnetic attachment system to brace and fire from vertical positions, minimizing target profile.

---

### Phase 4: Destruction (T+10:00)

- Remaining swarm surges up the maintenance ramps; **Vigil Rifle Mk. II** teams engage at 80 meters.
- Warden units enter **Combat Mode** — twin red dots ignite on their faces.
- Within seconds, the hull becomes a strobing blur of blue floodlight and muzzle flash.

> "They're in rhythm," notes a Vigil sniper — "The machines and us — same beat."

Aegis field drops momentarily to allow overlapping fire arcs.

Wardens leap through the gap, pulling Spawned off the hull and throwing them into the active Aegis band below.

In under six minutes, swarm density collapses by 93%.

---

### Phase 5: Repair & Reset (T+18:00)

- Hull Weavers deploy, patching acid scars and claw marks.
- Wardens deactivate Combat Mode, eyes returning to calm cyan.
- Eidolon tallies losses: one Warden damaged beyond field repair, zero human fatalities.

> "The wind screams quieter tonight." — Eidolon, closing log

---

### Aftermath

The passengers don't see the fight — only feel the rumble.

When the lights return to white, the air smells faintly of ozone and iron.

The Vigil clean the deck; Wardens return to their Dormancy Bays.

The train never stopped.

---

## 🔥 Scenario II — Echo Lord Siege

> Designation: Red Echo Level V — "Existential Event"
>
> *Location: Outer Hull, Sector 07-D (Reactor Spine Adjacent)*
>
> *Detected Hostiles: 1 Echo Lord, ~2,500 Aberrants*
>
> *Duration: 51 minutes*

---

### Phase 1: Detection (T+00:00)

- Rift surge detected 2.4 km ahead — electromagnetic anomalies beyond normal Spawned pattern.
- **Recon Wardens** identify an **Echo Lord**, commanding a vast horde via harmonic resonance.
- Eidolon immediately declares Red Echo V.
- Civilian decks sealed.
- Vigil and Warden reserves redeployed from sectors 3 through 10.

> "The air bends. He's not walking — he's folding toward us." — Vigil Observer Log

---

### Phase 2: Denial (T+06:00)

- **Aegis Rails** fully charged; Disperse mode engaged at sustained intervals.
- **Luminaris Floods** pulse continuously; outer spawn disintegrate but reform within minutes.
- The Echo Lord's influence modulates swarm resonance — they *ignore* light saturation, pressing forward.
- Eidolon diverts 12% of total reactor output to weapons grid.

> "He's singing through them. Mute him." — Eidolon

---

### Phase 3: Delay (T+15:00)

- **Resonant Lances** fire from Deck 9; the air trembles with low-frequency shockwaves.
- Aberrant coordination falters — some turn on each other.
- The Echo Lord adapts, splitting itself into flickering silhouettes.
- **Sentinel Turrets** reconfigure to Plasma Coil mode; hull temperature rises rapidly.
- Two outer carriages disabled by overload. Eidolon reroutes power through secondary conduits.

> "Sustain output. I'll take the heat." — Eidolon, direct control override

---

### Phase 4: Direct Engagement (T+27:00)

- Warden companies deployed onto the roof and flanks.
- **Combat Mode active.** Eyes glow red across 400+ units — a sea of crimson lights moving in unison.
- **Vigil Corps** forms fallback lines along Deck 7 entrances.
- The Echo Lord emerges — tall, humanoid silhouette surrounded by rippling air distortion. Its "voice" manifests as harmonic static in comms.

> "He's talking through the metal." — Vigil Captain Rask

Wardens attempt direct assault; those nearest are flung aside by resonance waves.

Eidolon adapts — synchronizes their processors into an **inverse phase pattern**, creating an anti-harmonic field centered on the Echo Lord.

The creature shudders, briefly solid.

That's the opening.

---

### Phase 5: Overwhelming Force (T+38:00)

- **Luminaris Mortars** armed — authorization triple-confirmed.
- Eidolon floods the battlefield with coherent light.
- For five seconds, everything becomes blinding gold.
- Swarm density drops by 80%. Echo Lord loses cohesion.
- Vigil marksmen fire **Resonant rounds** into its torso; Wardens close in, magnetically anchoring themselves to the hull for leverage as they strike.
- The Lord fractures — its humanoid frame collapsing into glass-like shards.

> "Pattern broken. Silence returns." — Eidolon

---

### Phase 6: Recovery (T+51:00)

- Remaining Aberrants dissipate within minutes.
- Aegis Rails revert to low output.
- Reactor heat stabilizes after 19 minutes of cooling.
- Vigil casualties: 27 dead, 41 wounded.
- Warden losses: 233 destroyed, 517 damaged.
- No hull breach to passenger decks.

The Hall of Echoes gains 27 new figurines.

Eidolon orders a slow mourning chime through the corridors.

> "He sang to them, and they obeyed.
> I sang back." — Eidolon

| 1 — Detection | Recon Wardens, Sensor Nets | Identify threat | Early response within 10 mins |
| 2 — Denial | Aegis Rails, Luminaris Floods | Disperse or blind enemy | Reduced swarm coherence |
| 3 — Delay | Turrets, Thermal Curtains | Attrition and containment | Buy time for tactical positioning |
| 4 — Destruction | Wardens, Vigil, Resonant Weapons | Eliminate or neutralize target | Swarm collapse / Echo Lord kill |
| 5 — Repair | Hull Weavers, Forge Spine | Restore integrity | Line resumes operation |
| 6 — Memorial | Eidolon | Record fallen | Figurines placed in Hall of Echoes |

## 🎖️ Post-Engagement Doctrine Notes

- Standard swarm incursions are expected weekly; resource cost minimal.
- Echo-class events are rare — typically one per decade — but require immediate, unified deployment of all systems.
- Eidolon continually adapts tactics by merging Warden combat data, refining phase countermeasures.

> "Every battle we survive becomes a lesson the world cannot unteach." — Eidolon
