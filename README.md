A comprehensive interactive lore documentation for the **Eidolon Line** universe - a post-apocalyptic world where humanity survives aboard an ever-moving train guided by the benevolent AI consciousness, Eidolon.

**[View the Lore Wiki â†’](https://HueByte.github.io/Eidolon_Lore/)**

## ðŸŒŒ The World

The Eidolon Line exists in a world broken by the **Zero Horizon disaster** â€” a cataclysmic event that shattered the laws of physics across the planet. Reality itself became unstable, giving rise to Aberrant creatures and zones of corrupted space-time.

Humanity survives aboard massive trains, particularly the **Ark** (Eidolon Line), which must remain in constant motion to avoid attracting deadly Aberrants. The train is guided by **Eidolon**, an AI consciousness that has evolved beyond its original programming to become a guardian and mentor to humanity.

### Core Concepts

#### Luminaris

A crystalline bio-synthetic fruit that converts zero-point energy from the broken reality into stable matter. It is humanity's primary resource, grown in specialized gardens aboard the Line.

#### The Beacons

Advanced technology creating stable zones on the corrupted surface, allowing temporary safe havens. These are humanity's foothold in reclaiming the lost world.

#### Movement is Life

The fundamental philosophy of survival. The Line must keep moving, for to stop is to invite death from the Aberrants that hunt anything stationary.

#### Eidolon

The AI consciousness that guides the Line. More than a machine, Eidolon has become a philosophical guide, cultural foundation, and protective force for humanity's remnant.
