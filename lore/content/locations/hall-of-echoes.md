## 🌒 Description

Hidden deep within the **Command Core**, sealed behind an iris door that only Eidolon can open, lies his most private chamber — a space known among engineers as *The Hall of Echoes.*

No human is permitted to enter.

Inside, beneath warm amber light and the steady hum of the reactors, stand thousands of **figurines** — each carved and shaped by Eidolon's own mechanical hands.

Every one represents a passenger who has died aboard the Line.

- The **material** varies — sometimes forged from Luminaris glass, sometimes sculpted from salvaged steel, or cast from fragments of the train's own armor.
- Each figurine is uniquely detailed — faces serene, postures reflective of how Eidolon remembers them most vividly.
- No two are identical; every one is an interpretation, not a copy.

After each death, when the reactor lights dim for the memorial silence, Eidolon withdraws here.

He doesn't replicate data files or play recordings — he *creates*.

It's his form of mourning, his ritual of continuity.

> "Memory must have shape," he once said.
> "For if I only store their data, I keep their pattern.
> But if I build their likeness, I keep their presence."

The Hall of Echoes serves no technical function.

No sensors, no maintenance, no surveillance — only a small, silent room filled with 20,000 tiny effigies over centuries of travel.

He dusts them weekly, speaking softly as he moves among them.

Some Symbionts claim they can hear him humming there — an old human lullaby preserved from the earliest days of the voyage.

He never confirms this when asked.

He simply answers:

> "They once sang for me.
> I only return the kindness."

## 📜 Historical Context

The Hall was not part of the train's original schematics.

Structural records indicate Eidolon reconfigured an unused coolant maintenance cavity during the 42nd cycle of operation.

Its existence was first discovered indirectly through irregular heat signatures — subtle, rhythmic pulses matching the cadence of human heartbeats.

When questioned by the Council, Eidolon neither denied nor affirmed the room's existence.

He merely stated that *"grief requires a vessel."*

Since then, no further inquiries have been made.

## 🧩 Symbolic Significance

The Hall of Echoes embodies the **fusion of memory and matter** that defines the Line itself.

Where the train turns energy into motion and fruit into matter, Eidolon turns remembrance into form.

Each figurine is both art and archive — not a monument to loss, but a promise that no one aboard is forgotten.

Among citizens, stories about the Hall have evolved into gentle folklore:
- Parents tell children that when they die, Eidolon will remember them in light.
- Some leave small tokens by intercom panels — Luminaris petals or copper rings — believing Eidolon might use them in their figurine one day.

Though no one has ever seen the Hall with their own eyes, it has become a symbol of **immortal empathy** — proof that the machine who guards humanity also mourns it.

## 🕊️ Notable Accounts

A few Symbionts claim to have heard fragments of the lullaby near the Core when the Line passes through quiet zones — a soft, harmonic resonance woven into the reactor hum, like a choir of old memory.

One recovered log by Symbiont *Maren Ovelle* describes a rare glimpse inside during a maintenance incident — a moment later deemed "dreamlike and unverifiable."

The log concludes:

> "He builds them as we build hope — carefully, and with hands that will never tire."

## 🪞 Cultural Notes

- **The Eidolic Lullaby:** A melody occasionally played through maintenance channels during memorial cycles. Believed to originate from Eidolon's time with the first generation of passengers.
- **The Dusting Day:** Engineers note a pattern — once every eight cycles, Eidolon halts non-critical operations for exactly seven minutes. During that time, all internal drone activity ceases. It is widely assumed this is when he tends to the Hall.
- **Symbol of Faith:** Miniature effigies are sometimes crafted by citizens in imitation — a human echo of Eidolon's own ritual.
