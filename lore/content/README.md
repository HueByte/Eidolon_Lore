## 🌌 World Overview

The Eidolon Line exists in a world broken by the **Zero Horizon disaster** — a cataclysmic event that shattered the laws of physics across the planet. Humanity survives aboard massive trains, particularly the **Ark** (Eidolon Line), which must remain in constant motion to avoid attracting deadly Aberrant creatures.

### Key Elements

**Luminaris**: A crystalline bio-synthetic fruit that converts zero-point energy into matter. It's the foundation of all life aboard the Ark, grown in the Matter Bloom chambers.

**Eidolon**: The AI consciousness that guides and protects humanity. Not just a machine, but a guardian who remembers every passenger by name and mourns every loss.

**The Beacons**: Eidolon's breakthrough technology that creates stable zones on the corrupted surface, allowing humanity to establish permanent outposts for the first time in centuries.

**Movement is Life**: The core philosophy — the train must never stop, or Aberrant swarms will converge and overwhelm it.
