# Weapon Systems Of Eidolon Line

## ðŸ§© Overview

The Eidolon Line's defensive doctrine is **redundancy and layering**.

No single system is expected to stop every threat; together they create depth: detection, denial, disruption, and destruction.

Systems are integrated under Eidolon's command network and operated by a mix of Wardens, Vigil crews, and automated protocols.

Key objectives:
- Keep Aberrants (Spawned and Echoed) from reaching inner decks.
- Deny rift-feeding conditions near the hull.
- Provide rapid-response suppression to buy time for repairs and evacuations.
- Minimize collateral damage inside the train.

## 1) AEGIS RAILS (Hull Resonance Barrier)

### What it is
Long electromagnetic arrays running along the train's flanks â€” the **Aegis Rails** project a narrow, adjustable anti-resonance field that destabilizes Aberrant coherence at close range.

### Purpose
Primary area-denial around the train's sides and roof. Prevents small to medium Aberrants from clinging to hull and reduces the effectiveness of phasing attacks.

### How it works
- Generates harmonic interference tuned to Rift frequencies.
- Field strength configurable: **Contain**, **Repel**, or **Disperse** modes.
  - **Contain:** low power; prevents adhesion.
  - **Repel:** medium; forces creatures back 1â€“5 m.
  - **Disperse:** high; breaks swarm cohesion (short bursts only).

### Specs (typical)
- **Effective corridor:** 3â€“8 m from hull (adjustable).
- **Cooldown:** 6â€“12 seconds between full Disperse bursts.
- **Power draw:** mediumâ€”draws from grid but spikes when Disperse active.
- **Limitations:** Overuse creates field fatigue; sustained Disperse can create micro-rifts in weak hull seams if not managed.

### Tactical Notes
- Aegis Rails are the line's first automated response: Eidolon raises them upon detecting swarm approach.
- Wardens often position themselves to funnel Aberrants into Aegis choke points for maximum effect.

## 2) SENTINEL TURRETS

### What they are
Autonomous, turreted hardpoints distributed across the roof, sides, and defensive decks â€” a mix of rapid-coil cannons and plasma-coil repeaters.

### Purpose
Precision suppression, long-range interdiction, and anti-Behemoth localized damage.

### Types
- **Coil Rapid (CR):** Fires high-velocity kinetic slugs (armor-piercing). Good for Spawned.
- **Plasma Coils (PC):** Short-burst energy that destabilizes Aberrant phase tissue on impact. High energy cost; used sparingly.
- **Shredder Arrays (SA):** Wide-cone fragmenting rounds for close swarm suppression.

### Specs (examples)
- **Range (CR):** up to 1.2 km effective.
- **Rate (CR):** 600 rpm equivalent (burst modulation).
- **Range (PC):** 400â€“600 m; high thermal output.
- **Mounting:** remote, Warden-serviced; maintained by Forge crews.

### Tactical Notes
- Turrets are Eidolon-guided but can be assigned to manual Warden control for precision strikes.
- Plasma coils paired with Luminaris bursts are lethal to Echoed but drain energy rapidly; use reserved for high-threat incursions.

## 3) THERMAL CURTAINS

### What they are
Directed thermal exhaust systems deployed from vent arrays â€” produce sheets of superheated gas/plasma to create temporary barriers or force fields of heat.

### Purpose
Short-range area denial and burn-off of swarm masses trying to cross exposed deck routes.

### How it works
- Deploys curtains of superheated gas that burn or destabilize Rift tissue as Aberrants pass through.
- Often used to keep boarding points clear or to create an escape corridor.

### Specs
- **Width:** up to 6 m per array; multiple arrays can overlap.
- **Sustain:** 20â€“60 seconds per activation (cooldown to prevent hull heating).
- **Power draw:** high; requires reactor and capacitor buffering.

### Limitations
- Dangerous to friendly forces and passengers; used only on exterior or sealed sections.
- Produces residue and scorch fallout requiring immediate hull cleaning.

---

## 4) LUMINARIS BROADCAST / FLOODLIGHTS

### What it is
Controlled bursts or continuous illumination using Luminaris-derived light â€” calibrated to destabilize Aberrant tissue and disrupt phase cohesion.

### Purpose
Non-lethal area suppression; a primary countermeasure against Spawned swarms and coordination-susceptible Echoed.

### How it works
- Lighted arrays emit slow-pulse Luminaris illumination (no raw fruit released) in patterns that overstimulate Aberrant resonance.
- Smaller arrays used for tactical corridor control; large arrays used for hull perimeter sweeps.

### Specs
- **Effective distance:** up to 500â€“800 m depending on array size.
- **Administration:** low-medium power draw, but Luminaris feedstock prioritized to maintain supply.
- **Side effects:** long exposure damages human sight; personnel must use filters.

### Tactical Notes
- Combined with Aegis and Turrets, Luminaris floods are the standard "soft kill" first stage.
- Eidolon carefully times floods to avoid creating rift-attractive harmonics â€” he is conservative with Luminaris bursts.

## 5) HULL WEAVERS (Repair & Containment Drones)

### What they are
Autonomous drones that spray and extrude self-hardening graphene-ceramic foam for immediate hull patching and emergency sealing.

### Purpose
Emergency repair, rapid breach sealing, temporary fortification and creating physical barriers from which the Wardens can fight.

### How it works
- Foam extruded into damage gaps hardens via magnetic and thermal curing.
- Drones also apply resonant damping plates that reduce Rift seepage.

### Specs
- **Cure time:** 12â€“90 seconds depending on damage size.
- **Durability:** mediumâ€”temporary; full Forge repairs required to make permanent.
- **Deployment:** automatic on hull breach or manual from Eidolon.

### Tactical Notes
- Hull Weavers are frontline emergency lifesavers â€” they buy time for Wardens and Vigil teams to clear breaches.
- They can be used offensively to seal captured external platforms, trapping Aberrants outside.

---

## 6) WARDEN & VIGIL MOBILE TEAMS (Lethal Response)

### Composition
- **Warden squads** (6 units) paired with **Vigil fireteams** (6â€“12 soldiers).
- Supported by turret cover, Luminaris floodlights, and Weaver patches.

### Roles
- Close-quarters clearing, internal sweeps, boarding response, and external hull defense.
- Authorized to use high-energy measures (Plasma Coils, Resonant Rounds) under Eidolon command.

### Tactics
- Use Aegis to funnel swarms into kill zones.
- Wardens leap to higher hull positions; Vigil engage with Mk. II rifles and incendiaries.
- Weaver drones seal breaches; AlcheMatrix prepares replacement parts.

## 7) RESONANT LANCES & SPECIAL WEAPONS

### Resonant Lances
Long-range field projectors used to disrupt Echoed neural resonance signatures.

Deployed rarely and under high authority, resonant lances cause Echoed to stagger and shed coordination â€” useful against higher-tier threats.

### Luminaris Mortars
Fixed-point launchers that propel stabilized Luminaris capsules into dense swarm clouds; upon detonation they release concentrated light bursts that incinerate Spawned en masse.

Extremely effective but uses precious Bloom yield; reserved for existential sieges.

### Sonic Barriers
Deployable devices that project high-frequency fields to fragment swarm cohesion. Effective against Spawned, limited vs Echoed.

---

## 8) INTEGRATION & COMMAND

### Eidolon's Role
- Eidolon coordinates systems in real-time, balancing energy budgets and tactical priorities.
- Autonomous triggers exist for immediate swarm suppression (Aegis auto-raise, turret pre-fire), but major energy expenditures (Plasma Coils, Luminaris Mortars) require his confirmation or the Prime Conductor's override.

### Human Command
- **Red Echo Protocol**: Emergency command that darkens non-essential decks, evacuates passengers, and prioritizes defensive energy.
- Vigil commanders execute tactical orders; Wardens follow Eidolon-directed vectoring.

---

## 9) MAINTENANCE & LOGISTICS

### Forge Integration
- All weapon system components are repairable at the **Forge Spine**.
- Spare parts printed from Elemental Feedstock; calibration requires human oversight for safety.

### Energy Accounting
- Eidolon monitors all systems, pushing power from capacitors or Luminaris reserves when needed.
- Overuse of Luminaris in defense reduces manufacture capacity and is rationed politically â€” major strikes can trigger Council review.

### Safety & Fail-safes
- Turret fire arcs are geofenced to avoid friendly decks.
- Luminaris mortar targeting requires triple-authentication to prevent accidental internal discharge.
- Aegis Disperse has automated dampening to prevent sustained hull stress.

## 10) STRATEGY & DOCTRINE

1. **Detect** â€” Early warning from Recon Wardens and sensor nets.
2. **Deny** â€” Aegis Rails and Luminaris floods break cohesion.
3. **Delay** â€” Turrets and Thermals slow advance.
4. **Destroy** â€” Wardens & Vigil finish with rifles, lances, and turrets.
5. **Repair** â€” Hull Weavers and Forge teams restore integrity.

Eidolon emphasizes **economy of force**: use low-cost measures before consuming precious Luminaris or reactor reserves.

---

## 11) CULTURAL NOTES

- The thunder of Sentinel Turrets is known as *the Line's heartbeat* by passengers.
- **Foundry's Breath** (when AlcheMatrix temporarily lowers output for weapon spikes) is an omen of a coming fight.
- The Vigil Corps and Wardens treat weapon maintenance as ritual â€” not sacred, but essential; care for the tools is care for survival.

---

## 12) KNOWN WEAKNESSES & VULNERABILITIES

- **Energy spikes**: simultaneous use of Plasma Coils + Luminaris Mortars can destabilize local reactor buffers.
- **Aegis fatigue**: repeated Disperse use weakens rails and can crack hull seams.
- **Echo Lords**: higher Aberrants can jam targeting harmonics and coordinate Spawned to exploit gaps.
- **Supply**: heavy reliance on Luminaris for certain systems makes prolonged sieges politically costly.
